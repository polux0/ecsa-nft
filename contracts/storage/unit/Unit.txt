The questions: Will the accumulated know-how of the species, alienated and, as Franco \\u2018Bifo\\u2019 Berardi (2012) put it, \\u2018looking for a body,\\u2019 lead to so-called humanity\\u2019s absolute demise (along with massive unrest and incalculable ecosystemic damage)?

       unit.push("Significantly, _Protocols for Postcapitalist Expression_ does not give up on economic calculation or computing. It acknowledges that Economic Intelligence exists in historically sedimented economic categories and practices, but at the same time it recognizes that the form of knowledge that existing accounting creates simply cannot care about, and much less _for_, everyone. Composing a virtual computer, capitalist accounting processes allow for the judicious, that is profitable, apportioning of resources by producing a matrix of the fluctuating costs of production. Capital accumulation may be optimized by watching, in Hayek\\u2019s famous phrase, \\u2018the hands of a few dials.\\u2019 However, this calculus remains an imperial project beholden to the myriad violences of racial capitalism. In order to operationalize the world, the integration of money and computing reconstitutes the world as numbers, which is to say, as information. Arguably, we could even say, information is itself a derivative of the value-form.[1] We might be forgiven for asking: does the collapse of values to exchange value, and more generally of qualities to number and thus to information have any liberatory potential whatsoever?\\n\\n[1] Information has emerged dialectically as the most general form for the products of capitalism defined as having both use-value and exchange value. Because of its abstract character, it is often forgotten that information must have a material substrate, be it the standard commodity or an array of atoms on a computer chip. For the briefest of sketches, consider that the commodity was always composed of readable material differences, differences in matter created through labor. As a wager to get from M to M\\u2032, the commodity\\u2019s market legibility as a significant state of informed matter (a \\u2018hieroglyph\\u2019) has become increasingly computational. For my take on the networked commodity and the intimate connections between computing and capital see Beller (2017 and 2021). In each text I develop the argument that the general formula for capital can be rewritten M-I-M\\u2032, where M is money and I is information: Information replaces the commodity \\u2018C\\u2019 in Marx\\u2019s classic formulation M-C-M\\u2032.");

Through the lens of economics and financial calculus, _Protocols for Postcapitalist Expression_ proposes a new form of economic intelligence and value-computing. The text proposes measures that do not collapse the qualitative concerns for well-being and being-with of those who currently are subjects of and subject to racial capitalism. ECSA has sought a way to allow for the expression and persistence of qualitative values on a computational substrate, an economic medium, such that these values are capable of (collectively) organizing economy. In theory, it becomes possible to avoid the collapse of people\\u2019s various pursuits into the value-form that is accumulated by capital and institutionalized through oppression, and to denominate quantities in terms of socially agreed upon qualities or qualifications, which is to say, values.

It actually proposes that \\u2018economy\\u2019 needs to become more granular and more generalized. What needs to be altered is _what_ the controls are, _who_ has access to them, and the kind of literacy and feedback they require. While _Protocols_ is a book of politico-economic analysis and insight, it should also be read as a script for the means to reappropriate the general intellect and thus use collective knowledge for the good of the social and ecological body. Surfaced from the unconscious operating systems of capital and reformatted, the protocols for constituting and holding equity become those for the distributed sharing of stake and thus for collectivizing risks and returns. The protocols for bank credit and monetary issuance become protocols for the peer-to-peer issuance of credit and for peer-to-peer credit clearing that is interoperable through a network of peers. The protocols for the organization of labor become protocols for the distributed assemblage of \\u2018performances.\\u2019 Units of account become qualified measures and indices, devoted to the emergence of interoperable qualitative values.

Altering the computing that backgrounds our sociality, _Protocols_ would create zones of just and convivial social production (cooperatives, ephemeral and enduring) attuned to the values of like-minded co-creators cooperating in forms of mutual aid expressive of their shared values and concerns.

It is no secret that the mega-media platforms and their hardware make money while they make us sick. In this 21st century recasting and expropriation of the general intellect, now giving rise to financialized AI, social media platforms absorb communication and consciousness along with all of our struggles for meaning, pleasure, connection, fulfillment and liberation. Their interfaces, algorithms and data-bases convert our all-too-human aspirations into private property and thus into capital. Thus, the expression of our struggles for happiness, knowledge and communion with one another produce an alienated and therefore alienating wealth for others. All those desires for liberation end up producing their antithesis: capital. By turning our meanings into accumulated data that function for capital as contingent claims on value that we will produce in the future, the economic logic of social media turns any and all politics expressed by means of its platforms, including the politics of solidarity, love and living otherwise, into a practical politics of hierarchy and capitalist extraction. By converting all of our semiotic signals into financialized information, and thus into profits, \\u2018social\\u2019 media stripmines our libido, our consciousness, our imagination. In doing so, all the points of meaning and affect distributed across the socius and absorbed in one way or another by computing can thereby be grasped for performing social and organizational functions in a matrix of financialized information.

In the current world operating system, for which social media forms only one, albeit _paradigmatic_, layer of calculation, the meanings we create and the emotions we experience, however real and \\u2018immediate\\u2019 they may be, are interfaces with computing; they are productive interfaces with racial capitalism.

       unit.push("It is in this context of the latest stage of capitalism that something really interesting can finally be said about the rise of blockchain and cryptocurrency. This cryptographic medium, which has the network architecture of a messaging system, is a medium in the strong sense, akin, as I have elsewhere remarked, to photography in the mid-1800s or cinema in the early 1900s. Without turning any of the apparent key players here \\u2013 the Satoshis and Vitaliks \\u2013 into heroes, we might see in the \\u2018mankind sets forth only such problems as he can solve [sic.]\\u2019 scenario of history, a significant emergence in response to a collective demand.

The alternative vision is a programmable substrate that opens computational media to the possibility of a (re-)programming of the economic layer of computing by non-state and non-corporate actors. If we want to put a point on it, the great disruption underfoot is that _economy becomes programmable from below_. That, in itself, is a change in the semantics, as well as the capacities, of economy. When we recognize that our communications media are overdetermined in their function by existing monetary media, to the extent that they serve as an extension of its profit seeking logics, we begin to see that our communications media are already economic media, even though their capabilities seemed to have developed in separate and even autonomous domains.");

It captures mass expressivity and converts it into capital. This colonization of the imaginary and symbolic registers results in a financialized cybernetics of mind. For democratization to happen in a meaningful way, the systems of accounts inherent in many-to-many distributed media, be they networked monetary systems (USD) or communications (Facebook), must become programmable from below. For this to happen, platforms and computing must be made programmable from below. The cybernetics of economic media must be deleveraged from capital accumulation.

Multidimensional valuation implies the creation of eco-social relations that can dialogically express and preserve discourse-based values on an economic substrate, while being programmable in real time by any and all participants. (Before anyone up and leaves at the sudden thought of having to wake up and program, think first of an interface like _Instagram_ with a tunable economic logic built in.

While the non-national dimension of cryptocurrencies introduced a significant rupture with conventional monetary substrates, platformed as they are as national currencies on nation states, their legally recognized institutions and their military police, this ultimately simple replatforming of singular denominations on distributed computing by existing cryptocurrencies is not enough. Bitcoin did in fact break the nationally managed monopolies on 21st century monetary issuance by introducing a scalable currency(/asset/option) platformed on distributed computing, but it has done, and can do, little or nothing to challenge the monologic denomination of value as a one-dimensional, that is as a unitary, currency format. Bitcoin may contest the nation, but it, and its fetishism, is all about it being an option on the value-form as historically worked up under, and as, capitalism.

Outlining the emergence of a far more robust economic medium than what is currently wet dreamt by the \\u2018when Lambo?\\u2019 crypto bros going on about libertarian forms of self-sovereignty, _Protocols_ posits a transformation not just of economy but of sociality, of subjectivity, of national politics and of ecopolitics by means of the composition and recomposition of relations of production. For those actively working in the ECSA project, what unites us as current contributors, even among our many differences, is that the radical development of economic media means that the intelligence of sociality, including that which has not been subsumed, can work for the socius, rather than be captured, farmed, privatized and put back on the market in an arbitrage on knowledge, where proprietary innovation captures the returns.");
       unit.push("As _Protocols_ explains, robust economic media mean that, through the equitable nomination of new asset classes and the collective denomination of values (practices which will require networked recognition, participation and validation), innovation can be collectively shared rather than capitalized. The text argues that through the sharing of stake, wealth, whose actual origins are inexorably social, can be socialized. We might add that _Protocols_ intimates that society might ultimately be decolonized because it would, after a time, no longer be organized from the imperial standpoint of Value. The deep plurality of being, though suppressed in commodity reification and egoism alike, but in fact constituting each and all, might at last be felt and actualized. It means, in short, that the other person might at last become not a limit to your freedom, but the realization of it.");
       unit.push("Note that no other major crypto project addresses the world in these terms. Nor do they think very deeply, if at all, about the adjoined problem of sovereignty _and_ subjectivity, or the cybernetics thereof. It has become clearer to the participants in the ECSA project that the form many recognize as the sovereign individual is but an iteration of the value form, an avatar of capital.[2] But given these economic and formal overdeterminations of agency and the reign of this type of sovereignty, we see that history, or at least collective survival, demands better chances. We have had enough of egomania and nationalism. The significance of things on the ground must be registered and economically expressed. To those ends, _Protocols for Postcapitalist Expression_ is in pursuit of something of a different order; something that must _risk_ the increasing granularization and resolution of computing and of the economy that computing has always expressed. _Protocols_ must risk this granularization and resolution _because that is what is already happening._ But collective survival necessitates something that also simultaneously enables a _detournement_ of extant economic logics and practices. ECSA\\u2019s analysis recognizes that the concentration of agency, whether in the form of the propertied individual or of the propertied immortal individuals called corporations and states, requires the collapse of the concerns of others, of their perspectives and of their information. It is precisely the refusal of that collapse that motivates the work presented in _Protocols_.\\n\\n[2] Whatever its specific embodiment, the sovereign subject that dominates Western philosophy is the subject of property. \\u2018He\\u2019 is semiotically, psychologically ideologically, and materially constituted through \\u2018his\\u2019 whiteness and cis-masculinity, the outputs of the representational and material systems that are among his dividends from colonization and slavery.");

Today\\u2019s socio-economic systems threaten insolvency, war and extinction. They threaten all forms of meaning-making that are close to the flesh and close to the earth: desire, the imagination, consciousness, speech, writing, landscape, oceans, the body, the self.

Indeed, it is the _incapacity_ to do just this granular and collective reformatting of the economy that has marked the failure of previous revolutions. Thus far, beyond the initial desperation, beauty and romanticism of revolutionary movements, we have mostly had various efforts at a seizing of the state that result in the reintroduction and replication of the gendered, racial and hierarchical logics of capitalism. From the Soviets, to the PRC, to scores of post-colonial states, we are familiar with the outcomes. The limitations were both of imagination and technology; movements weighed down by default notions of centralization and bureaucratic organization, notions that informed both emergent states and the discrete state computing that would develop to run them and all the others.

This banking evolved over the next few centuries from funding commerce to funding the rise of industrial production, and a system we call capitalism.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi), like Web3, is offering the alternative to this corporate control by developing decentralized credit issuance and other financial products of risk management. But can DeFi develop the extra stage and link to the funding of investment in new systems of production? We believe that this requires an analytical leap: to think of stake (ownership of investment) as the preferred collateral for reciprocal issuance of credit.[6] It will give credit a material and expandable foundation. Financing investment in new forms of production (performances) will itself open up new possibilities for DeFi that link to the \\u2018real\\u2019 economy.\\n\\n[6] The trend to use equities as collateral for loans is increasingly prevalent.

It issues treasury bonds and oversees the yield curve, it sets the base interest rates from which commercial rates follow and it manipulates exchange rates, etc..

Public policy is clearly more concerned to produce outcomes more than just outputs. Adopting the same framing, our use of the terms is that performances produce outputs but the network attributes value (it validates output) based on social outcomes. However, as will become apparent, it is necessary that ledgers record outputs, but these are always validated outputs (that is, they are recognized as having produced certain outcomes).

These performances may indeed find recognition in the network as value-creating, even when this is not the intention of the performing agents.

One use of the term arises in the context of \\u2018proof-of-stake,\\u2019[18] where people stake their holdings of a token as collateral to become validators of ledger transfers of that token. A second form of staking is lending tokens that others may borrow (e.g. for use in derivative trades), generating a speculative yield to ownership. A third is collateralizing (staking) tokens for a loan in a stabletoken, which can then again be invested or staked (and the process rinsed and repeated, many times). These practices led to token markets becoming increasingly leveraged, and susceptible to the price crash that happened in 2022.[19]\\n\\n[18] The need to cut energy usage in ordering transactions on a blockchain has seen the system of verification shift rapidly from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.\\n [19] Staking, in this sense, is often also incentivized by (often absurd) returns in the protocol native token, or in the protocol\\u2019s native token in combination with some other protocol\\u2019s token.");

In our analysis, staking involves taking on a financial exposure to the success/failure of another person or group\\u2019s (agent\\u2019s) creation of output. In aggregate, it gives a network a shared exposure to the future. It is a process of investing in new performance, and it generates returns based on the success of that process.

Tokens are at the service of a ledger, and the balance on the ledger records the good service or asset being transferred in one direction and a token transferred in the other direction. The question, of course, is what you can do with a token issued by another person.

We then shifted to our own priority of building postcapitalist performances of value creation. So how do we frame the connection from capitalist frontiers of finance to a postcapitalist economy of value-creation? This connection forms the substance of the rest of this book, but our path into it starts by depicting the difference between capitalism and postcapitalism as a financial \\u2018spread.\\u2019");
       unit.push("The core questions that define the financial spread are: \\n- What counts as liquidity? \\n- What counts as collateral? \\n- What counts as \\u2018surplus\\u2019 and \\n- Who decides each of these?");
       unit.push("_The liquidity question_. Who has the right to issue? In capitalism liquidity is about the state, the banking system it superintends and the money it endorses. When only those state-approved agents can issue, then a liquidity premium (a rate of return on money) can be charged for the risks involved in holding illiquid assets, because an exchange may not be found quickly.[22] The new economic space challenges this hegemony as the source of money issuance, proposing instead p2p reciprocal issuance amongst agents in a network. But what they issue is not \\u2018money\\u2019 as conventionally understood. Tokens in the network we propose are not private money, but claims on other agents: offers from one agent that are accepted by another and registered by the transfer of a token. Where all agents can issue in this sense, there need be no network shortage of liquidity and hence no liquidity premium.[23] The provision of liquidity can be fully collateralized by stake, and this collateral, rather than a liquidity premium, covers lending risk.[24] Because collateral derives from the process of reciprocal staking it is the network overall that carries default risk. Stake becomes the complement of liquidity.\\n\\n[22] Stripped to its basics, the liquidity premium is a cost that addresses the deepest, darkest fear of capitalism: that the market (people to sell to or buy from) will simply disappear in sufficient numbers so that the flow will stop. This point, and the necessity of the dealer function, has been emphasized to us by Colin Drumm (2021), see also Treynor (1987).\\n [23] For explanation see L\\u00F3pez, J. \\u2018Market credit: Distributed liquidity protocol.\\u2019 http://marketcredit.manifold.one\\n [24] This is the practice of shadow banking.

In the new economic space, agents' performances that create \\u2018value\\u2019 (as defined collectively by the network) forms the basis of collateral, for stake price is linked to value creation. In capitalism it is the capacity to create profit that defines stake as collateral; in postcapitalism, it is the capacity to create collectively defined value that defines stake as collateral.

       unit.push("_The surplus question._ What proportion of output is in excess of the costs of producing it, and who lays claim to the excess? The former is a measurement question; the latter the social access (class) question. Historically the determination of surplus was a process of extraction. In slavery and feudalism the surplus is that output in excess of the costs of sustaining slaves or a peasant class of producers. It is predominantly a surplus in the form of goods and services. In capitalism surplus is a financial concept because it is implied that all the components of output and hence the \\u2018excess\\u2019 can be commensurated, via units of value.[25] Surplus takes the financial form of rent, interest or profit.[26] Postcapitalism opens the question of how a surplus is to be defined (how costs and outputs are to be specified and measured: units of value and the unit of exchange) and claims of access to this surplus. In particular, where value is not defined by reference to profit, (some part of) surplus may be attributable to a commons.\\n\\n[25] A unit of value will be explained in Chapter 6.3. Suffice it here to define it as a socially/ historically specific system of measurement.\\n [26] There can be an argument that the concept of \\u2018profit\\u2019 is not specific to capitalism; what is specific is the way profits are calculated.

Implicit here is the idea that a postcapitalism, when framed through finance, can be depicted as an economy of abundance. This is not in the sense that too many commodities are produced, or that no-one will want for anything, but that when \\u2018value\\u2019 has diverse forms (not just profit-based) and is determined via distributed processes, we will all discover an abundance of economic activity, verified by a plethora of economic data analytics, which was hitherto performed without social recognition, and thereby no doubt under-performed.\\n\\n[27] We note the blurring of the categories of money and assets.

More recently, it is introducing to cryptoeconomics the possibilities of distributed banking and insurance: that assets need not lie idle, but can be mobilized for borrowing and lending and with mechanisms of insurance offered on the side. The emergence of a rapidly-growing market for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) is further accelerating this development, creating marketable assets whose sale creates collateral for further rounds of lending. Lending is then giving rise to the potential for leverage: borrowing in order to take positions in markets. That, in turn, is opening up issues like collateral requirements with margin calls and default risk. Predictably, we are already seeing the issuance of derivative financial products like credit default swaps (CDS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) designed to on-sell default risk from those who wish to avoid it to those prepared to carry it for a fee.[28]\\n\\n[28] Toporowski (2010: 12) puts it succinctly: \\u2018in an era of finance, finance mostly finances finance.\\u2019");

Derivatives therefore trade risk positions: the risk of the price of a barrel of oil going up or down, without trading the barrel of oil.

The basis of trust is not that the state monetary authorities or banks will \\u2018do the right thing\\u2019 in their policy discretion, but that there is knowledge that a) all credit is fully collateralized (Chapter 8); b) default risk will be spread across the network (because ownership is dispersed, see Chapter 5) and c) all agents understand the liquidity requirements of others by understanding their own liquidity requirements (Chapter 8). A breakdown of liquidity, such as happened in the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the 2019-2022 pandemic crisis, is itself a breakdown of sociality because the centralized financial system highlighted the difference between individual interest (wanting to receive liquidity, but not give it) and collective interest. In a distributed economic system, all economic agents must take responsibility for the provision of liquidity, and performance indices must produce measures to verify the need for and conditions of liquidity. This is why the mutual issuance of credit is critical to the Economic Space Protocol, for it makes provision of liquidity and the distributed, not hierarchical, sociality of the network integrally related.");

This is a price determined in point-in-time exchange between the agent and the network (ultimately another agent) for a quantum of tokens in an open market.

This will be found for outputs that find no direct price but become inputs into other outputs that do find a direct price. Here is where the maintenance of a chain of information is critical. By following a chain of output-becoming-inputs-becoming-outputs to a point where a direct price is found, the network can retrospectively attribute a share of that direct price to formerly-unpriced inputs back down the chain (see Appendix 4.2). \\n- _A tribute._ Some right transfers will fit the category of a gift. These could be between individual agents but, most critically for the Economic Space Protocol, these may be gifts to the commons (see Chapter 6.3). The counter-gift is access to the commons, on terms at the discretion of the commons. \\n- _A synthetic price._ This is a price which can be created by the network to account for outputs which are consumed collectively, most notably those given as tribute. The formula for a synthetic price is (socially validated) costs of production + the average rate of return for the network. Some outputs in the network can be said to produce value (they are socially valued) but they are not designed to be sold. When the network wants to value these (for example in calculating total output of the network) it may invoke a synthetic price.");

Protocol design can generate a systematic expansion of the Commons (see Chapter 6). \\n- _Valuing collective performances._ Some outputs won\\u2019t be sold, even though they may give social benefit.

It does not require creating a higher-powered agent like a board that coalesces preferences into discrete events and chooses a majority over a minority.

It links closely with the following chapter on stake, which engages the way in which performances are valued by the network.");
       unit.push("Performances must also be understood as protocols of a network. This is a process of recognising performances as a sequence of events, making them both composable and divisible, so that they can be encoded (see Chapter 4.3). They are also interactive: across the network, they must be perceived, communicated and enacted. So each performance always includes an offer to the network, describing its organization, proposed outputs, proposed outcomes of those outputs, how their value should be measured, token issuance, governance, surplus distribution, etc.. Performances thus have scripts \\u2013 to \\u2018perform\\u2019 the sequence of events \\u2013 and are to be understood as expressions to be evaluated by the network.");
       unit.push("A performance is akin to what economics calls \\u2018production,\\u2019 but we utilize the broader term for the following reasons: \\n- \\u2018Performance\\u2019 puts the emphasis on creativity and innovation of those performing, unlike \\u2018production\\u2019 which is often associated with the repetitive discipline of a production line. \\n- How a performance is designed and implemented is determined by the performers, unlike production which is often associated with hierarchical control. \\n- A performance has an audience; production has a market. An audience may pay directly to consume/participate, but it may not. Part of the innovation of the new economic space is the recognition that contributions to value can take multiple forms: they won\\u2019t all be expressed through direct exchange in a market. \\n- It follows that there must be mechanisms of social (audience) acknowledgment and verification that value is being created. The returns to performers that come from a social acknowledgment of value creation are determined by relations of staking between agents, not extractive relations of wage labor and capital.");
       unit.push("So performances express what makes a postcapitalist economy a different experience for those participating in it: it places their creativity and their intention to create social meaning at the center of the economy and scripts them as offers to the network. It is then up to the network to determine whether these proposals warrant support by staking. Here is where the diversity of values, and different modes of measuring value, take on practical meaning, both in agents\\u2019 decisions about what to produce and how to produce it, but also in their claims to create value for the network.");

There are inputs of labor, materials and technology, all acquired by exchange, and there are outputs sold for money. So there is an account for what goes into production and what comes out, but what goes on inside the production process is unexplained. Marx was decisively different in this regard. Marx depicts the relations in the process of production as the defining feature of a capitalist economy. It is the domain of the owners of the means of production (the employer of labor). The workplace runs at their discretion and wage workers must comply, subject to some degree of legally-imposed standards. These are the social relations Marx depicted as extractive: where workers produce more net output value than their wages can purchase. They produce a surplus, belonging to the owner.");
       unit.push("In a postcapitalist economy we need a different analysis of the organization of performances.

However, although those \\u2018performing relations\\u2019 are determined by participants, they are nonetheless subject to network scrutiny. Performing relations are themselves a performance offer to the network, and subject to network evaluation in the same way other performance proposals are subject to network evaluation.

It is likely that performances offered to the commons will be open rather than closed performances.");
       unit.push("In elaborating the nature of performances there are concepts that we will first define separately, and then bring together: \\n- _Information: any performance-related data recorded in the network._[80] The network will \\u2018automatically\\u2019 create the possibility of recording a vast range of data. These will most obviously be about times, places and prices of exchange, but there can readily be produced adjunct data. These could be about performance scripts, design and execution, the agents and their trading histories, time intervals between offers and network matching, intensities of interest from other agents, agent satisfaction, networks of connection between exchanging agents, state changes in the project organization, bits transferred, documents created, and more. \\n- _Event: sets of data thought to have a combined meaning (a data narrative)._ Data analytics could readily be built on top of these raw data. The simplest analytic we call an _economic event_: the identification of data happening in combinations (a+b)[81] where a and b could be raw data or themselves compiled from statistical analytics. One can imagine a tree of a\\u2019s and b\\u2019s combining to form new, \\u2018higher-order\\u2019 a\\u2019s and new b\\u2019s. \\n- _Events in combinations: events (data narratives) which can cause desired effects_. Events are devoid of a causal proposition over time. But when we propose causality (a+b leads to c), we invoke the conditions for a performance. Events in combinations may then be treated as higher-order events themselves. When data are encoded as narratives, they adopt the grammar of value, but still lack the verification of the network that is the condition of value. \\n- _Performance: innovation and risk._ Events in combinations propose causality, but no innovation. So if the proposition a+b leads to c were posed in the subjunctive tense \\u2013 if a+b _were to_ lead to c \\u2013 we add a contingency, for a+b may or may not lead to c. The subjunctive proposition becomes a risk exposure when the occurrence of c has consequences which can be expressed financially. This is a performance in the domain of taking a position on the future: a performance, framed in the subjunctive, with financial consequences. \\n- _Performance index: measuring the execution of a performance._ This is a specific calculation on the information produced by the technical data on performance (it is the result of a mathematical formula). It has a magnitude that is expected to change over time. It also has a type, which is the particular dimension of quantifiable measurement (e.g. transaction speed, liquidity index, average transaction volume, carbon footprint, engagement index) that makes all performances commensurable in these dimensions. \\n- _A measurement of value: network responses to a performance._ This involves the identification of whether a performance has met its verifiable outcome targets (measures of social effects) sufficient to be validated by the network as the creation of value. No measure can be made until the completion of a first performance, but this measurement serves as information for staking on second and subsequent performances. \\n- _Stake: network calculation of future performances._ This results from the preparedness to invest in some ownership of a performance. Stake frames contingency as potentiality. It takes the contractual form: \\u2018I am prepared to stake an asset in expectation of a yield, should future events occur.\\u2019 All the above data can impact decisions to stake a performance, but most obviously the performance index and the measurement of value.\\n\\n[80] The network holds all records, of which the ledger is just one type; for example, records of offers made, even if they do not get a match. Moreover, it warrants emphasizing that it is performances that encode information with meaning.\\n [81] By \\u2018+\\u2019 in this context we mean simply \\u2018in combination with,\\u2019 where combinations may be expressed in any way that is deemed to have economic significance.");

Either way, it involves the identification and quantification of a continuous set of indicators, that are defined at the time the performance is offered for stake. Quantifying occurrences makes different outputs quantitatively commensurable (as a spread), without reducing them to a single measure.

When we frame that as a relation to capital and production for profit, all labor stands collectively as the creators of output and capital collectively as the owners of the output.\\n\\n[82] Sraffa (1960) proposes a Marx-compatible approach to value that is not centered on labor time.

The difference is subtle, but significant.");
       unit.push("Labor-based approaches struggle to deal with the \\u2018value\\u2019 of outputs where marginal costs are virtually zero. This problem was originally posed in this sort of value theory as the difficulty of putting a value on nature. Nature, being created without labor, could be treated as the exception. But today, intangible outputs like software, networks and knowledge are increasingly prevalent in the economy, but labor time in production seems to explain very little.[83] Our depiction of performances associated with exchange is designed precisely to account for the collective contribution of intangibles in new, creative ways.\\n\\n[83] The proposition is not that labor theories of value cannot explain intangibles like software, for the labor of the software designer could indeed be counted. It is that little about the significance of software in value formation is going to be explained by this attribution.");

In our analysis, value comes from the attribution of social recognition, and we will later identify how this recognition might be measured, but these are not proxy prices. The \\u2018conversion\\u2019 from values to prices, if there is indeed such a process, is expressed through staking: how agents change their staking decisions in response to value measures, but it is a tendency only; not a formal connection. This is why we focus on the _performance as the mode of expression_ of value. A performance may be initiated by an exchange in a market but, in contrast with subjective preference approaches, it is the social meaning that can be built around the exchange, not the exchange itself, that is critical to value creation. Moreover, and unlike \\u2018objective\\u2019 approaches to value, the goal is not to explain each commodity\\u2019s value in terms of output metrics, but to identify a network perspective on what outputs are deemed to create value for the network: how a producing population of agents creates, funds and maintains collective benefits for the network.");

       unit.push("The critical innovation of social impact bonds is that they design a bond for a private investor to purchase, where the funds raised from the bond sale are spent on an experimental public policy intervention (i.e. where the outcome is unknown). The intervention must be undertaken by an \\u2018independent\\u2019 third party, not a party to the contract, to ensure the results are verifiable. The bet for the investor is whether the intervention will achieve a pre-specified level of success (if, for example, a group of prisoners that receives the intervention has 20% lower rate of recidivism than a control group). If the intervention is successful in achieving its 20% target, the investors get a payout; if not, they lose their money.[87]\\n\\n[87] In practice, the investors do not lose all their money.

In the depiction of performances presented in this chapter, this is an important feature: the performance offer must declare its claims to independently verifiable outcomes, and the probability of these targeted levels being achieved enters into investor calculation about staking the performance. In a social impact bond, independent verifiability is undertaken by a separate institution: neither the state nor the investor, but the third party commissioned to undertake the intervention. In the new economic space, it is believed that network-generated data will be the primary source of independent verification. However, an agent could offer the performance of verification services to the network.");
       unit.push("Second, the design of social impact bonds enables the quantification of social phenomena generally thought unmeasurable.

This spread is the objective of calculation. If the intervention achieves a 20 percent spread, the intervention is deemed successful and the investor gets an agreed bond payout; if not, the investors lose their money.[88] This closes the intervention: the investor has received payment (or not) and the state has discovered whether the intervention is worth permanent funding (or not).\\n\\n[88] Social impact bonds involve the government funding an experimental intervention to determine whether it should receive on-going state funding.

Second, it advocates drawing a difference between outputs and outcomes. Outputs are generally easy to quantify: number of reports or recommendations, surveys conducted, dollars spent, tonnes of this; hours of that, etc.. But outputs are not ends in themselves. It is on outcomes that policy aspires to exert an impact, and outcomes have to be measured differently from outputs,[89] often via the \\u2018spread method\\u2019 developed in social impact bonds.\\n\\n[89] The questions of how, when and how often to measure outcomes have become big questions in public sector use of the evaluation framework, as they will be in a new economic space.");

What the _Magenta Book_ emphasizes in a policy context is that the critical task is to measure the _outcomes_ of outputs. In the new economic space, the measure of outcomes is the equivalent to the process by which the network attributes value to the outputs of a performance. It is asking the question of whether a performance output led to the creation of something of value.

Without a pre-specified, external notion of value (e.g. by reference to profit) staking immediately opens an economic and social imaginary of what the priorities of that future could be, both individually and collectively. It gives the network a dynamic of growth, disruption and realignment, and the collective, exploratory choice of direction.");
       unit.push("The process of agents in a network taking stake in each others\\u2019 performances could be subject to a range of economic and social interpretations.

If posed outside the Economic Space Protocol, this is a possible meaning.");
       unit.push("In the context of the Economic Space Protocol, staking points in a different direction, although partial parallels with a capitalist stock exchange should be acknowledged, and the contrasts should be drawn to make the differences stark.

Four key points of comparison feature prominently in this chapter.");
       unit.push("First, unlike the stock market, the market for stake involves _reciprocal_ investing. Agents enter the network not with a quantity of money with which to acquire stake in others, nor by offering themselves as wage workers (both of which would then play out an extractive logic of growing wealth inequality), but with proposals for performances or with propensity to participate in others' performances actively and/or financially. We see a shift towards what Marx called \\u2018free association\\u2019 and individual \\u2018self activity.\\u2019[90] The role of the Commons in expressing this propensity towards postcapitalism, is explored in Chapter 6.\\n\\n[90] For Marx, this stage was directly contingent on advanced technology developed in capitalism and involved the proletariat freeing itself of capitalist class relations so that this individual expressiveness and free association could flourish. This technological development and its social conditions Marx referred to the \\u2018force of production\\u2019 or \\u2018productive forces.\\u2019 In the words of Marx:\\n The appropriation of these forces [of production] is itself nothing more than the development of the individual capacities corresponding to the material instruments of production. The appropriation of a totality of instruments of production is, for this very reason, the development of a totality of capacities in the individuals themselves . . . .\\n This appropriation is further determined by the manner in which it must be effected through a union Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds with the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting off of all natural limitations. (Marx 1854, Part 1, Section D)");
       unit.push("Second, the criteria of performance success are different for stock and for stake. In broad terms, in capitalist countries, corporate governance legislation requires making profit to be a priority objective,[91] with just a small amount of wriggle room to enable recognition of so-called social, environmental and governance input (so-called ESG accounting). In the new economic space, the goals of investors and performances are not pre-specified. We refer here not to the recognition that some investors may be altruistic, and not profit-driven, for that also happens in capitalism. Rather, the network\\u2019s goals are determined in distributed processes and subject to change according to the changing view of the network.\\n\\n[91] There is nonetheless ambiguity here, especially about how profit is defined and the time horizon for profit maximization.");
       unit.push("Third, stock and stake involve different risk allocations. New stake is created and issued as part of a mutual stakeholding transaction. In effect, each party to the transaction, and their respective networks, are underwriting each others\\u2019 issuance. As stake forms collateral for credit, the parties are also underwriting each others\\u2019 credit issuance. The intention, as with stock market equity, is to expand net value creation and hence the net value of stake itself. Although new stake issuance \\u2018dilutes\\u2019 the proportion of total stake held by extant stakeholders, it is associated with an expansion of the performance potential of the underlying assets. The new stake therefore opens a new risk (the expansion) but also a shared risk (the underwriting).");
       unit.push("Fourth, mutual stakeholding transactions are strategic and continual and they convey critical information to the rest of the network. Issued stake quantity, price and transaction data are essential feedback, for they signal network perceptions (current and anticipated future) of the value creation capacities of each performance. Those perceptions about network recognition can change. Agents may seek to realign their stake portfolios by acquiring more stake or they may partially or fully exit a staking relationship. This depiction may also describe the decision-making process of a hedge fund or venture capitalist, but mutual staking makes both the risks and the consequences of staking decisions markedly different.");
       unit.push("Behind staking are acts of exchange: in transacting stake, there will be offers and matches recorded on a network ledger.[92] It follows that we are starting to see the conditions for the emergence of tokens as representations of these transactions.

This analytical sequence means that, at this stage of the analysis, there is not yet an elaborated unit of exchange in the network (see Chapters 7.2 and 9), so staking, as considered in this chapter, involves the determination only of relative values (ratios or equivalences) and just a conceptual reach to how they might be made operational as absolute values.\\n\\n[92] The mechanics of this process are examined in Chapter 10.2.");

It is the _ratios of allocation_ that prove critical: how much stake A must be given up in order to acquire a unit of stake in B may be different from how much A is ready to give up to acquire a unit of stake in C. What these ratios reveal is the network\\u2019s _relative_ view of each agent\\u2019s past and expected performances: those with the highest ratio (who have received the largest amount in stake offers, relative to others, and whose stake price is rising) are deemed the greatest contributors to value creation (see Chapter 7.3 for the process). The higher your ratio, the more the rest of the network values your performance relative to other performances. Reciprocal staking is the determination of these ratios. The process by which these ratios appear as absolute numbers is not considered until Chapter 8.4, for credit and liquidity are key to this development.");
       unit.push("Even though the differences in prices between the stake tokens of different agents are vital to the system\\u2019s functioning in the short and medium terms, as means of empowering agents proportionally to the perceived value of their performances, they may create imbalances in the long term.

One such policy is stake decay: as the stake held by an agent increases as a determined rate or to a determined level, some part of that stake will start decaying into the network (other stakeholders or the commons), according to a function.

Stake not only enables the diversification of risks (which is indeed one form of pooling); it also expresses the way in which individual agents who stake a performance combine to form a new agent defined by their common purpose (a new economic space), and in turn the way in which performances combine to form aggregated networks. \\n- _Commensuration of performances._ Stake price makes all different performances commensurable, and hence creates the idea of an economy of collective innovation and interoperability among economic agents. But it does so, critically, without reducing the measurement of performances to a single index: it intentionally preserves the importance of diverse ways of measuring the value-creation of each performance. \\n- _Revealing network Value priorities._ When each performance is presented to the network in terms of the values it extols, staking choices are a voting process on values.");

In neoclassical economics, focussed as it is on exchange relations, the surplus is in individual relations between buyers and sellers: it is the spread between the price a buyer/seller would have been willing to accept and the price at which they do accept an offer. In Marx, surplus value is a class-based spread between the value of labor power (approximately equal to the wage) and the new value created by current labor. Piero Sraffa\\u2019s (1960) adaptation of Marx, which has been an important underlying influence in our analysis, poses the surplus as the spread between the commodities used up in the process of production and the commodities created by the process of production. When we extend Sraffa from a commodity world to a financial world, the surplus is simply output values created that are not paid for. Non-payment is not about theft, but the capacity of human endeavor to create, such that inputs into production are not sufficient to account for the value of outputs.");

The Sraffian surplus includes Marx\\u2019s surplus, albeit that the emphasis is not on extractive relations (i.e. that one class produces the surplus and another owns it) but its analytical benefit is that it can describe also a surplus in market-based, commodity producing societies that are precapitalist (late feudal) and a postcapitalist (a \\u2018market socialist\\u2019[102]) economy. Sraffa\\u2019s ledgers resonate with those we describe in later chapters, and give us some tools to describe a postcapitalist surplus.\\n\\n[102] Sraffa was not particularly an advocate of \\u2018market socialism\\u2019: a term which arose in the context of the 1920s Socialist Calculation Debate which Hayek claimed to have mastered (see Chapter 2.4).

If surplus is attributed to the human endeavor to create, then we should not presume that the creative outputs of that endeavor are only and always commodities produced for a market.

Further, although a tape may be rolled out to measure distance, there is no such formula for asset value.[112] The hidden lesson from the analogy is telling: all measures are social conventions, but only some can be adopted as if they are invariant. Money and asset values are not in this subcategory and to assume that they are serves simply to displace their contestability into some other social dimension.\\n\\n[112] A tape measure can verify that some spoons are 20 cm long and others 22 cm. No computation is needed. But to say one spoon is worth $2 and another $12 rests on social conventions of attributing value.");

These will contribute to the network enacting new value forms in a way compatible with the network\\u2019s ledger practices. Although not all are exclusive to a postcapitalist system, they will have distinctive postcapitalist dimensions to their compilation and use in explaining the behavior of the asset categories of stake, credit and commodities.");
       unit.push("Below are the prevalent measures. \\n- _Measure of value._ The outcomes of performances must be measured in a way that network value cant be attributed. Every performance proposal cannot be presumed to create \\u2018value\\u2019 for the network; the network must express an evaluation of whether the effects of the performance (its outcomes) are sufficient to be declared \\u2018value.\\u2019 The measurement here is related to the determination of \\u2018what is sufficient\\u2019 and it can only take the form of a spread between what was offered and what was then achieved. It cannot be a single network-wide unit of measurement (like a tape measure) for it is specific to each performance. \\n- _Market Offers._ These measure value in exchange. When matched, market offers are a way of measuring the rate of exchange at any given time between any two commodities, referred to as exchange value. When unmatched, exchange offers are understood to express views on potential exchange value. The exchange value of any asset can be calculated in terms of any other, but it is convention to use one specific asset to express these offers.[113] This asset is given the status of \\u2018money of account\\u2019 and is used to communicate exchange value in a standardized way. In the Economic Space Protocol, this asset is credit denominated in the unit of exchange. \\n- _Unit of exchange; unit of credit_. These measure commodity and credit rates of exchange. The unit of exchange is utilized as a common denominator in which to express exchanges, enabling the matching algorithm to gradually fill an order. Rather than \\u2018deriving\\u2019 the unit from the exchanges, we acknowledge its presence from the start, and express all exchange offers with it. This does not require credit, but just divisibility of the assets being exchanged in \\u2018chunks\\u2019 of these units. This unit becomes most visible to the users, when it is utilized to create units of credit which are, basically, credits measured in units of exchange.[114] \\n- _Commodity Specifications._ A distinct class of commodity (or particular attribute of multiple commodity types) can be compared qualitatively and quantitatively, A commodity specification is the aggregate of information (not just provided by the issuer of the commodities) that can be created by the network to enable a comparison. \\n- _Performance Metrics_. These measure the level of economic activity in the network. Associated with stake, a performance metric is derived from the records of the performance of an economic space, and compiled into distinct quantitative data that can be compared throughout time. As distinct forms of measurement and valuation, they are important benchmarks that influence the participation and the staking decisions of agents on a particular space. Anyone can create and publish a performance index, or adopt them. Performance metrics can be tokenized, be distributed as dividends, utilized as qualified and quantified forms of participation recognition, and/or exchanged in a market. \\n- _Offer matches over a unit of time._ These measure exchange value flow. We can trace the value flow between any two agents, or any two groups of agents by compiling the information contained in the offer records, where time can also be \\u2018tick time,\\u2019[115] represented by the overall offer matching events, within the range being measured. This is valuable information for agents\\u2019 credit issuance and staking decisions. \\n- _Stake exchange value_. This measures \\u2018economic space agency.\\u2019 It is important to measure the exchange rate of a particular space\\u2019s stake in terms of units of exchange. The larger this value is, the larger the capacity of an agent to exert influence in the network, and express value. This unit compresses, but still retains, the assemblage of the qualities and quantities associated with an economic space.\\n\\n[113] In Chapter 1 of _Capital_, Marx referred to the relative equivalent forms of value, with the equivalent form as the benchmark against which other commodities are measured. Money becomes the \\u2018universal equivalent.\\u2019\\n [114] The unit of exchange and the unit of credit are similar, in the way a 100 dollar bill and a 100 dollar check are similar. Even though they both use the dollars as the measurement, they are two distinct instruments that pertain to two distinct accounts and two distinct risks. This distinction is clear from an accounting perspective, although not so much from a general use perspective.\\n [115] On tick time, see Chapter 3.5.");
       unit.push("The Economic Space Protocol challenges the traditional notion that exchanges must involve a money instrument in order to be executed. With distributed token issuance, tokens are not a store of value and stake is not converted to free-standing tokens when sold. Performance metrics, not just price, determine the network\\u2019s valuation of an asset. Abstract units of exchange are deployed to increase the matching capacity of an exchange offer. These modes of measurement are associated with three distinctive exchange practices of the new economic space. \\n- _An abstract unit of exchange._ Exchange offers are expressed through an abstract unit of exchange, where the rates of exchange between any two commodities are translated to these units. Through netting, exchanges can occur without the need to hold and then use a mediating financial instrument (i.e. money). This is of particular importance, since money in a capitalist economy is effectively the \\u2018right to express exchange value.\\u2019 \\n- _Reciprocally issued credit._ The Economic Space Protocol\\u2019s money equivalent is reciprocally issued credit, denominated in units of exchange/units of credit. Agent credit issuance, like agent stake issuance, is determined by the lending/investing parties and is integral to the process of value determination in the network. Staking processes signal the network determination of value-creating performances; credit issuance and settlement through clearing \\u2013 and the determination of what performance outputs can be credited \\u2013 expresses value in a monetary form. \\n- _No interest credit._ Credit in the Economic Space Protocol does not generate interest payment in the capitalist sense. This frees agents from following the profit seeking heuristics of capital, and to focus instead on other forms of surplus transfer denominated in different units, and representing different measures of value (see Appendix 5.2). Dividends do not need to be converted into credits in order for them to be distributed. This is a different way of distributing the value that agents create, where an output (or an outcome), needs not be framed to be seeking a market.");

       unit.push("This is a conspicuously different agenda from capitalist ways of measuring. In capitalist economies, the accounting conventions associated with \\u2018value\\u2019 attribution centers on the profit system, and those conventions evolved to express the calculative priorities of a profit-centered economy.[116] The price of a good or service is conditional on it meeting profit conditions for its supplier (or supply will discontinue); the valuation of a capital asset is conditional on its expected future capacity to generate profit; the rate of interest and of rent charged are valued with the objective of securing a return for their providers at least equal to the rate of profit.[117] Optimisation models that sit on top of these categories are about valuing assets and determining their \\u2018best\\u2019 uses with respect to maximum profit. There are indeed debates about measurement, but they are within prescribed limits. They focus most prominently on issues like historical cost versus fair value accounting as the most appropriate way to record profit-centered measures.\\n\\n[116] The principle of standardized capitalist accounting first emerged in the 1850s, along with the legalization of joint stock companies (companies with shareholders) and limited liability. Investors needed standard performance metrics so that they could compare corporations and make informed investment choices and state protection against responsibility for the legal consequences of corporate actions. We know that these standard metrics, conventions and rules have been constantly evolving since then, but the connection of ledgers to profit has remained throughout. See, for example, Chiapello (2007), Levy (2014), Hopwood and Miller (1994) and Bryer (2000). Of course the proposition is not that everything in a capitalist society is expressed through profit criteria, but that this is the defining social feature of the era. Activities outside profit criteria are interpreted through the discourse of subsidies (and taxes), philanthropy or being classified simply as \\u2018non-economic.\\u2019\\n [117] Current conventional accounting can adopt a unit of \\u2018capital\\u2019 as its measure because capitalist accounting has been built for the specific purpose of defining and measuring \\u2018capital.\\u2019 This is the accounting dimension of the so-called \\u2018Cambridge Critique\\u2019 of capital theory which argues, in essence, that there is circularity in the conventional theory of capital: the value of capital cannot be specified until its rate of return is known and its rate of return cannot be known until capital is valued.

       unit.push("An implicit assumption to date has been that markets are liquid. It is a widespread assumption in economics and has enabled all sorts of theories to simply ignore or marginalize the question of illiquidity, especially at the level of individual agent relations. It is a misleading assumption. Agents face what Perry Mehrling (2011), following Hyman Minsky, calls \\u2018the survival constraint.\\u2019 Expressed simply, \\u2018[i]f you can\\u2019t roll your funding as it comes due, you are dead.\\u2019 This constraint goes to the heart of exchange, and we see it manifesting everywhere as businesses going broke and people losing their homes due to illiquidity.[118] Yet for Hayek, market participants agree to a price but there is no bid-ask spread;[119] for Marx, commodities are assumed to exchange at their value, and illiquidity is framed as a source of crisis, not as an integral variable of exchange. Indeed, in Chapter 3, where we first introduced our categories of exchange, we explicitly assumed market liquidity for the simple reason that liquidity is a system-wide issue: it can only be understood in the context of the flows of the overall network, and that\\u2019s not the place to start an analysis.[120]\\n\\n[118] It should also be noted in this context the trillions of dollars (or other fiat currency) of central bank \\u2018quantitative easing,\\u2019 for the explicit purpose of propping up liquidity in financial asset markets.\\n [119] This point is central to Sraffa\\u2019s critique of Hayek: that when supply and demand are not in equilibrium, there is a difference between the spot rate and the forward rate. This spread forms the concept of commodities having an \\u2018own rate of interest\\u2019 (Sraffa, 1932: 50). This framing fed into Chapter 17 of Keynes\\u2019 _General Theory_ (1936).\\n [120] Marx would make the same claim.");
       unit.push("We know liquidity to be contingent on the social relations that secure ongoing capacity in market processes, and those social relations are themselves unstable. An economy based on staking performances is always opening a time interval between the performance offer and recovery of costs of mounting a performance, or the time taken for the completion of a \\u2018circuit of performance\\u2019 (to use a term adopted in Chapter 11.2).[121] Volatility and liquidity are tied together. These issues can now be addressed, although further layers of understanding will also be added in later chapters.\\n\\n[121] Reference here is to Marx\\u2019s circuits of capital in Volume II of _Capital_ (1885, Part 1) and our own interpretation of a performance circuit in Chapter 11.1 and 11.2.");
       unit.push("The key to liquidity is access to credit. Credit is an IOU. In the Economic Space Protocol, credit gives an agent the right to amend the network ledger \\u2013 to match an offer and issue a token \\u2013 when that token is, in effect, provided by another agent. But to frame credit as just a personal relationship between two agents would miss its significance in the network, for the issuance of these IOUs also connects directly to issues of securing network liquidity. In the absence of centrally-issued money, and the associated capacities of a central bank to regulate liquidity, distributed issuance of credit performs money-like functions that must create and sustain liquidity. In this chapter we address the issuance of IOUs and the conditions of their settlement (credit clearing).");

It is important to address at the outset of a consideration of credit a widespread popular perception that debt (the flip-side of credit) involves the social and financial subordination of borrowers to lenders. It is a relationship predicated on extraction. We share that view. Our focus on credit rather than debt is not semantic. Credit is about connecting the present to the future and no economy can work without credit. It secures network liquidity and brings forward the capacities of agents to create that future. Debt re-expresses credit by reference to the attached obligations; invariably with a focus on interest payments. But in the new economic space there is no role for interest payments and no incentive for any agent to agree to pay interest on credit. One of the expressions of distributed issuance of credit is that it brings to the attention of every agent the contingency of liquidity and their own capacity to alleviate illiquidity. It is in their own interest to issue credit; it doesn\\u2019t need the payment of interest.");

The idea that all agents can be banks is rhetorical when we think of banks as institutions, but the idea that all agents can be issuers as well as receivers and clearers of credit is entirely serious. Indeed this is at the center of Hyman Minsky\\u2019s approach to finance: \\nTo analyze how financial commitments affect the economy it is necessary to look at economic units in terms of their cash flows.

Put slightly differently, within a network of credit, where agents are both borrowers and lenders, no agent can know which particular chain of credit they link to,[126] so there is a logical demand for a common unit in which to express credit (Doepke and Schneider 2013).\\n\\n[126] Fleischman et al.(2020) offers an interesting twist on this proposition: the identification of credit loops which could be cleared by the temporary injection of an agreed monetary unit.");

In summary: \\n- _Stake tokens are shares of an economic agent\\u2019s output._ They give the user the capacity to receive dividends through their application programming interface (API).

This right can be verified through their AIP. If a clearance is successful, a liquidity token with any remainder is returned. It is an exposure to future potential states, but without carrying the risks of those states (except for default). It involves the advancement (and writing down) of credit to meet the immediate liquidity requirements of the network, both those between agents to maintain their accumulation and the matching and netting requirements of achieving settlement in exchange. \\n- _Commodity tokens are an exposure to an offer for an agreed output._ They are the most programmable token type, and can hold any interaction logic and carry any given rights.

This style depicts the economy as a sequence of critical inter-connections, located in space time, that combine to secure the conditions for the reproduction of the flow.

       unit.push("When stake is used as collateral for credit issuance (Co\\u2013Cr), a change in the value of a performance, and hence of stake, means that the value of collateral will change over time.

There will be clear incentives for collateral to be based on a pooling of staked performances. This is the momentum of \\u2018risking together.\\u2019");
       unit.push("Hence, when credit is used to fund the acquisition of inputs for the agent\\u2019s next performance (be it repeating the same performance or innovating a new one) (Cr\\u2013Pe), it is apparent that the playing out of risks of the previous circuit impacts on the capacity of this agent to mobilize future credit. The signal of that risk evaluation is stake price.

       unit.push("Collateral is stake, qualified by risk, and measured by the unit of exchange. Stake exists as a (diversified) portfolio of unique, differentiated assets.

But these will have to convert to other units for recognition across the network.\\n\\n[151] Outside money (Gurley and Shaw, 1960) could be fiat currencies or other forms like bitcoin.

Nonetheless, a commodity entry of dollars does create an implicit exchange rate between the protocol unit of exchange and the dollar, for commodities and stake can be priced in either. Nonetheless, the entry of dollars and the creation of an exchange rate has significance. First, the exchange rate will impact where agents source commodities and how they fund stake, indicating that there are no clear boundaries to the network.

This focus represents what is distinctive about commodities in the 21st century compared with the eras of both Marx and Keynes: the rise to prominence of intangible outputs whose value-as-commodity is so difficult to specify (see Appendix 5.1).\\n\\n[153] Despite reference here to Marx, our use of the term \\u2018commodity,\\u2019 explained in footnote 71.");

But the stark, consequential expression of output evaluation is the preparedness to stake the process of their creation, and this can be clearly measured in a market process. Perhaps, it might be said, shifting from commodities being exchanged (Marx, Keynes) to performances being staked, and referring to this as the \\u2018simple\\u2019 form of value, is stretching the word \\u2018simple.\\u2019 But, we believe, this is necessary as a way of recognising the prominence of information in commodity-money relations.");

In this expanded version, information is not just the means by which individual agents make decisions about the future (what to stake). It is also the means by which the collective of agents (the network) reaches its determination of what constitutes value. For both Marx and Keynes, the rule of profit is central to delineating what parts of the economy grow via a cycle of profit and investment, and what parts shrink. For them, what constitutes \\u2018value\\u2019 is a resolved parameter, defined by the protocols that constitute capitalist accumulation. But in the new economic space, without a predetermined measure of \\u2018value,\\u2019 expansion becomes a more fluid process, for when agents stake performances, they not only project its creative success on a two dimensional scale (how profitable it will be) but now also on a third dimension (what will be judged socially to be valuable).

Hayek and the neo-classical economists are disposed to this view. Others, in the tradition of Keynes, (also) reject fundamental value specifically as it relates to asset prices.

       unit.push("A token only comes into existence when an offer is matched (and expressed through the creation of a debit and a credit record on corresponding ledgers). As an aggregate, we can compile a list of offers. Thus an offer expresses the potential creation (supply) of a token. An exchange offer between a good or service (Q), and a token instrument (M), where Q units are in the bid and M units are in the ask, denotes the exchange ratio relationship between Q and M, that can be interpreted as the price (P) of a Q unit, in terms of M. V is the speed at which M is issued and cleared; an issue of liquidity considered Chapter 9.");

V then constitutes a multiplier where a net revolving amount of M, is required to fulfill all offers of Q at price P. Thus M x V = \\u2211(PM \\u00D7 Q) (per period of time used to calculate V).");
       unit.push("Where Q1P1 can be matched with Q2P2, netting represents an instant exchange, or it could be said that the M component can be netted away.

Because every token offer (potential M) must be matched by a \\u2018commodity\\u2019 (PQ) in order to become \\u2018actual\\u2019 M, then M and PQ are \\u20182 sides of the same token offer.\\u2019 And in this context, with every match the M that is specific to it expires. New M comes into being with a new offer validated by its matching. In effect, the velocity of a token is infinite, so M tends towards 0: that is, the settlement of an exchange is at once the expiry of M. There is money flow, but no money _supply_ required: M can be deemed to have been simultaneously issued and redeemed. So MV=PQ is definitionaly true, albeit not quite as an identity (as it is in the quantity theory of money), but as a protocol design.");

Put simply, netting presupposes the existence of the things to be netted, yet their delivery to market will not be simultaneous with the offer. Temporal gaps open a need for credit to provide liquidity to the time interval. Hence fundamental value must be explained in the context of credit and the need to create liquidity across a time interval. In this context, credit itself has fundamental value: delivery on its promise of future exchangeability.");

This is not a proposition that current nation states are redundant, for there are many centralized facets of society, and the rule of law is a conspicuous one, which impact directly on the economy. The new economy will exist in any foreseeable future within a mainstream social and economic context. It is simply presenting an alternative economic way of being and doing, and it offers a protocol that can be readily adopted by anyone, without the sponsorship of any nation-state.");
       unit.push("How the new economy interfaces with the conventional economy is an open design space, but also a domain of uncertainty. The specific objective of our analysis is to present the case, and it can be no more than a case, that, after an initial bootstrapping phase, the Economic Space Protocol offers a set of economic relations that can be self-reproducing. There will be porous boundaries between the conventional economy and the new economy: fiat money, commodities and people will move between the two systems. Indeed it is likely that every single user will have a foot in each system. But it is critical that we can present an economic logic for a coherent alternative that can become independent of constant financial top-up from outside (for example in dollars). A design goal is that the new economy can produce a surplus that generates its own conditions of continuation and expansion.");
       unit.push("Self-sustainability in a narrow economic sense is important, but it would be a modest achievement if the alternative we are proposing looks pretty much the same as the existing system. The new economic space we are proposing offers a new vision of economic relations: the conditions of increasing equality of living standards, the creation of environmental health, and an economy sensitive to the aesthetic, cultural, and emotional attachments of participants. These are the collectively-determined, socially-defined conceptions of calculable value creation, or what we can term simply \\u2018network value.\\u2019");
       unit.push("NETWORK VALUE");
       unit.push("The contention throughout this analysis is the capacity of the new economic space to incorporate performances creating outputs motivated by network value, and the capacity of the network to reward the performances that animate network value creation. We need to make as clear as possible the connection between network value, rewards and system reproduction. It requires all elements of the Economic Space Protocol, and all the earlier chapters to be brought together.");
       unit.push("Performances motivated by network value are already familiar: philanthropy, crowdfunding, etc. are all expressions of this agenda. The challenge is to show the conditions under which network value is sustained and reproduced without the need for continual injections of outside money. In other words, the social surplus recognized in network value needs to be seen as equivalent to profit in capitalism: where the market evaluates and rewards performances with a yield of some form recognized by the network, either through individual agents or the commons.");
       unit.push("Outputs being \\u2018recognized by the network\\u2019 is the term we use rather than \\u2018selling for a profit,\\u2019 for many performances may not generate profit; indeed are not targeting that objective.

       unit.push("The \\u2018yield,\\u2019 if not profit, must be in a form acceptable to the network: it could be commodities, credit, stake or indeed any kind of governance or access rights. The condition of the network being capable of self-reproducing is that the yield takes a form that the network can use for its reproduction: the yield is, or can be converted to, the inputs required to open another circuit of accumulation. This capacity to form a circuit is critical to the difference from philanthropy, which requires on-going injections of outside money for a new circuit to commence.");
       unit.push("The question remains: how does the network systematically recognize the values that animate performances, such that those values are recognized and reproduced by the circuit of accumulation? Here, the issue of staking is pivotal. The market-based determination of which performances agents are willing to stake is the network\\u2019s way of declaring what sorts of outputs (and the notions of value they embed) the network is backing financially. If we assume that staking is undertaken for reward, as described above, it must be the case that the ways outputs get recognized by the network provide the conditions of reproduction of the circuit, including the remuneration of stake.");
       unit.push("However, this is not a sufficient framing to complete the argument, for it is posed only in terms of the conditions of reproduction of individual stakes and individual outputs and their outcomes; not the network as a whole. The additional dimension relevant here is that stake is the collateral for credit, and credit is paid down out of both commodity token exchanges and rewards for performances. With a focus on the conditions of issuance and repayment of credit, the analysis takes the general form, expressed now in the network\\u2019s unit of credit. The ultimate test of the network\\u2019s embrace of network value, and outputs produced in accordance with that value calculus, is whether a commodity token, received in return for the provision of a particular commodity output, will be accepted by (all agents in) the network for purposes of clearing credit. Its acceptance is network verification; its denial is the opposite.");
       unit.push("Acceptance will not be a sudden and arbitrary determination at the moment of offer, as the above depiction may seem to suggest. Information flows in the network, taking the form of performances (for data must be encoded with meaning), will be providing agents in the network with real-time information on how offers are being evaluated and matched. So, working backwards from the acceptance of a commodity token in paying down credit, we can identify the social logic that leads to its likelihood of acceptance: the commodity token must relate to a commodity deemed valuable, which must come from a performance deemed value-creating, which is funded by stake deemed by a critical number of staking agents to be an investment in value creation and deemed by the network as providing collateral worthy of credit issuance.");
       unit.push("This is the general process by which the Economic Space Protocol supports and sustains an economy of network value. In the new economy, everything depends on everything else, as it does in a capitalist economy or any economic system. The taxonomies and measures, the systems of valuation and rewards and the pulses that keep the system moving are all mutually defining. It cannot be otherwise. At the core of the Economic Space Protocol is a simple proposition: in a distributed economy, everything depends on the generation and processing of agent-generated information, and the way that information is compiled, evaluated and acted on must also be agent-centered. So the Economic Space Protocol is a case for agent-centered internal credibility and coherence, and the condition of entry is the desire to experiment.");
       unit.push("WHERE TO FROM HERE?");
       unit.push("The protocol design principles of the new economic space have required that we cover some detailed and diverse conceptual and philosophical issues and combine them with the capacities of programmable protocol design.

       unit.push("The proposal presented here makes the case that the conditions of postcapitalism lie latent within capitalism and, to make that latent potential imminent, we must develop ways to engage capitalism at its contemporary frontier of innovation; to go beyond, rather than to turn back. In particular, we need to engage three related elements.");
       unit.push("First is the emergence of a digital economy, which provides the technology to build that digital future, even though it is also integral to many of the incapacities of current capitalism to meet many social needs (notably well-paying \\u2018jobs\\u2019);");
       unit.push("Second is the risks that people are currently experiencing in their individual and collective lives: most obviously the risks of individual financial precarity on the one hand, and environmental destruction on the other.

This will include, but is not restricted to, risking to innovate to address issues of inequality and environmental destruction.");
       unit.push("Third is the rise to economic and social dominance of a culture of financial calculation. Individually, this is expressed as the need for debt to acquire housing or gain education or, for too many, to undertake daily subsistence.

Currently, this culture is expressed in the rise of banking and insurance as a site of both political power and economic crisis creation, but also a site of extraordinary innovation. We seek to take over that innovation.");
       unit.push("So we have adapted the capacities of post-blockchain technologies for protocol design to create ways for people in a network to risk together using financial techniques of staking, derivatives, liquidity, volatility, etc.. We are creating an economic media for postcapitalism.");

For some readers, this will have taken them through debates and specifications that felt excessively detailed, and perhaps even at points semantic, but we believe that language is important. The old categories always pull us back to old ways of posing and answering problems. Our project has seen us, over quite some time, imagining future economic possibilities and then having to configure the categories as well as the analysis that will bring them coherence. It has, we agree, made for a challenging read. Nonetheless, we are confident that, for all this analytical detail, when it comes to being part of the network and living in the performances it enables, the operational design can be quite simple.");
       unit.push("To get to that stage, where people are living at least aspects of their lives in a new economic space, more development work will be needed. This document has intentionally left unaddressed how the new economic space has a financial bridge to the capital markets, and a full exploration of the \\u2018outside spread\\u2019 that will likely drive capital market engagement with the new economic space. These developments await responses to the current document.");
       unit.push("These are complex, but solvable issues. They become solvable not because there is a decisive answer but because protocol design embeds indeterminacy, volatility and ambiguity. The question will be whether the Economic Space Protocol has embedded them in coherent ways that enable creative adaptation of agent practices and of the protocol itself. For now, we present the network as its own internal logic; as a way of depicting a viable, evolving, distributed postcapitalism, where participants design their own futures, both individually and collectively.");
